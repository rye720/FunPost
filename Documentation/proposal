In this day and age social media has fundamentally changed many aspects of our lives. It has allowed people to communicate from 
all parts of the world simultaneously. With this incredible amount of people all connected together, we now look at the 
different ways that they interact with one another. Text, images, and video are all well represented in the world of social 
media but our team believes we have come up with a very different spin on one of these major types of communication.

For our project we would like to build a web application where users can make posts on a website that other users can see. These
posts will be limited to just a title and an image. The unique thing about this website is that users may only respond with 
other images. This makes the users wanting to comment on a post have to convey their thoughts and feelings in the form of 
another image. It also makes other users think much more deeply about what the poster is trying to say, or wanting them to feel.

We anticipate this site will primarily be used for Memes but it has the potential to be much deeper and more thought provoking. 
We like the idea of eliminating written comments because it takes away some of the ability for arguments, or at least makes them
more difficult to have. A feature we would like to have on our site is the ability to register with a Facebook or Twitter 
account. This would allow the registration process to be very quick and let the user start posting right away.
